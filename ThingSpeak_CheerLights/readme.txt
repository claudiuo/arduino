This sketch connects to ThingSpeak and polls the CheerLights channel every 16 seconds; uses the value received to changed the color of an RGB led.

There are probably better ways to connect to the Internet - modify the code later if needed.

Original sketch was written to drive GE Color Effect Lights but I modified it for an RGB led. All original credits have been kept.
